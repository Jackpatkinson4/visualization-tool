# Visualization Tool
This is the source code for the Visualization Tool used for Georgia Tech's CS 1332 which covers all data structures & algorithms taught in class. It is hosted using Github Pages, and you can visit it at: https://rodrigodlpontes.github.io/visualization-tool/.

## About

This tool is based on the already excellent [website by David Galles](https://www.cs.usfca.edu/~galles/visualization), and has been updated to include more data structures and algorithms, as well as to use ES6 syntax and React.

## API

The animation "API" is very well documented [here](https://www.cs.usfca.edu/~galles/visualization/source.html). Existing JavaScript files are also a good reference for learning how to do things.

## Future Work

There is a lot that still needs to be improved, ranging from implementing more data structures and algorithms, making slight modifications to existing ones, bug fixing, updating the UI and making general improvements. Whatever your interest in web development is, you can probably improve your skills by contributing in that regard!

For more details on what needs to be done, check out the [Projects page](https://github.gatech.edu/rpontes3/visualization-tool/projects). What is outlined there is just to help guide development though, so feel free to contribute with whatever you think would be useful!
