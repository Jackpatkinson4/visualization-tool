## About

This tool is based on the already excellent [website by David Galles](https://www.cs.usfca.edu/~galles/visualization), and has been updated to include more data structures and algorithms, as well as to use ES6 syntax and React. 
The CS1332 Visualization Tool was adapted and expanded by [Rodrigo Pontes](https://rodrigodlpontes.github.io/website/), with the help of Miguel de los Reyes and Alex McQuilkin and under the supervision of Prof. Mary Hudachek-Buswell. It includes the data structures and algorithms as they are presented in the course.
